# How To Use

This project is built with a local flask server and it uses twscrape a python library to webscrape twitter

To make this work you need an account that will be used to scrape twitter

to do that you will have to make a Credentials.JSON file with the next file structure:
{
    "User" : "ExampleAccount",
    "Password": "Example Password"
}



The project has to be run onto its root folder

This project implementation its meant to provide an example on how to use nosyBird to make your own server, but I have to declare that the server implemmentation will not be made so it will work if you change the file structure provided
