# What it's this project
Here I am showing you a little example on how to use NosyBird to make a fun twitter game where you add n users to guess who liked the tweet

# Notes
To make the scrapper work you'll need credentials to twitter, you can setup this with the NosyBird Library but if you just want to run a demo you'll have to create a 
Credentials.JSON
{
    "Username" : "exampleUser",
    "Password": "examplePassword"
}

This project has to be run onto it's root folder so the routes work properly

You can change the flask server http in the main.js and you can change the file dependencies on the flask server initial nosyBird config

Check the sample.py to check out how NosyBird


# If you just want to run it
Just run the server on its root folder and launch the nosyBird.html on a server(not live server)
